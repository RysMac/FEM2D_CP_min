# FEM for CP

## TO DO LIST:
    # 1. reduce the problem to 2D small strain plane strain - done
    # 2. change the computational problem to 2D compression/shearing - done
    # 3. change BC so the final deformation is realized in few steps - done
    # 4. solve it by minimization not by solving set of linear equations - done
    # 5. extend it do plasticity with 1 than 2 than 6 slip systems
    # 6. try to do periodic boundary condition

## Plasticity - tasks

    1. add slip system function
    2. extent local energy function
    3. add yield function
    4. add another field
